I received my Bachelor of Engineering degree in electrical and electronics and my Master of Science degree in biological sciences from the Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS), Pilani, in 2017. 
I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. under the supervision of Univ. Prof. Muhammad Shafique at the Computer Architecture and Robust Energy-Efficient Technologies (CARE-Tech.) Research Group, Institute of Computer Engineering, Technische Universit√§t Wien (TU Wien), Austria. 
I was a Visiting Researcher at TU Dresden for a span of one year in 2016, where I completed my master thesis. 
My research interests include embedded machine learning, fault-tolerant computing, wearable architectures, healthcare systems, and energy-efficient technologies.
